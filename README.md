TensorFlow Object Detection API is a powerful tool for object detection and recognition, which can be used for identifying different types of fruits from images or videos.

<br>

Steps:

<ol>
<li> Collect and prepare your labelled sample set of fruits which will be used for training the model.
<li> Install TensorFlow Object Detection API
<li> Split your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
<li> Configure the model by selecting the appropriate architecture, adjusting hyperparameters, and setting up the training pipeline. You can use a pre-trained model like SSD.
<li> Train the model using the prepared dataset and configuration. 
<li> Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance on the testing set to see how accurately it can identify fruits.
<li> Finally, you can use the trained model to identify fruits in new images or videos by feeding the images through the model and getting predictions for each image.
